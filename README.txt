About: 
This program calculates maximum 3 Person Family based on a reservation list

Please use IDE: Eclipse or IntelliJ for the code. 
1. Create new project on the IDE
2. Create new class called PassengerSeat under that project
3. Copy the contents of PassengerSeat.java in the Git to the created class
4. Run the program

Frameworks and other classes:
1. Collections
2. Stream

Idea:
1. Replace letters in the String with zeros which helps in identifying seats occupied by family of 3 members
2. Convert String to a List of integers and sort it.
3. Calculate repeated values and find triplicates
4. Deduct number of triplicates from maximum possible 3 member family seats and return
